# Web-Development-Calendar
In the month-by-month view calendar project, I build a simple calendar that allows unregistered-user to see dates of each month and registered-users after signing in or signing up to add, edit, delete events, add group events and share events with friends dynamically. In detail, I use phpMyAdmin to handle MySQL database containing users and events. Use PHP to build the connection to database. All requests were made via AJAX, which helps to make sure the page do not need to reload. Combine PHP, JSON, Javascript to implement different functions, like adding, deleting events. Javascript and jQuery are used to handle the reloading of data on the calendar and populate the page with information. Also, I have to pay attention to web security with measures such as FIEO, one-way encryption, CSRF token, http user agent consistency and http-only cookies.
